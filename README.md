# Book-List

Developed this book list web app just to practice my basic knowledge of Javascript in the real world. Used OOP concept to perform a lot of tasks in the script.js file.

**Functionalities**

User can add book names, author and also a unique code for each book in the ui. On demand the user can also remove books individually.
The browser saves up these books in the local storage so that even after reloading the page, no data is lost.

**What did I learn?**

This is the first time i got to implement my OOP skills in a project. I used to think that I already knew OOP in depth but during this project I realized that I was wrong.
I got to sharpen my css skills as because one of my priorities was to make the web app responsive. One more thing to add is that I am really fond of the services offered by the 
Local Storage.

**Realization**

You can never master something without implementing it in your own way.
